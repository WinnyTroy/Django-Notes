##Models  

A model is a single definitive source of information about your data. It contains the essential fields and behaviours of the data you're storing. Generally each model maps to a single database table.  

Each model is a Python class that subclasses django.db.models.Model  
Each attributr=e of the model represents a database field.  


The most important part of a model -and the only required part of a model is the list of database fields it defines.
